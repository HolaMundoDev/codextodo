# Codex Todo

This is a simple ReactJS to-do list application that does not use any external state management library. Tasks are stored using React's built-in `useState` hook.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

## Building

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Testing

There are currently no automated tests. The `npm test` script outputs a placeholder message.
